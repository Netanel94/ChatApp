## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and ts-node (`npm install -g typescript ts-node`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local installation)
- [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/) (recommended MongoDB GUI client)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Netanel94/ChatApp.git
cd ChatApp
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
# or wherever your backend code is located
```

Install backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your environment variables:
```env
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd ../frontend
# or wherever your React app is located
```

Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
```env
VITE_PUBLIC_FOLDER=http://localhost:8000/images/
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Option 1: Run Backend and Frontend Separately

**Start the Backend Server:**
```bash
cd backend
npx ts-node index.ts
```
The backend server will run on `http://localhost:8000`

**Start the Frontend (in a new terminal):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Vite development server
```
The React app will run on `http://localhost:5173`

### Option 2: Run Both with Concurrently (if configured)

If you have a script to run both simultaneously:
```bash
npm run dev
# This would run both backend and frontend concurrently
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Setup

### Using Studio 3T with Local MongoDB
1. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine
2. Open Studio 3T
3. Create a new connection:
   - Connection Name: `ChatApp Local`
   - Server: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
   - Port: `27017` (default MongoDB port)
4. Connect to your MongoDB instance
5. The application will automatically create the `ChatUsersDB` database and required collections when you first run it
6. You can view and manage your data through Studio 3T's interface

### Database Schema
The application uses the following main collections in the `ChatUsersDB` database:
- `users` - User accounts and authentication data
- `messages` - Chat messages and metadata
- `conversations` - Chat room/conversation information

You can explore these collections in Studio 3T once the application creates them.

### File Storage
- Uploaded images are stored in the `Pictures` directory on the backend
- Files are served statically at `/images` endpoint

## üì± Usage

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Register a new account or login with existing credentials
3. Start chatting with other users in real-time!
4. Create group conversations with multiple users
5. Upload and share images in your conversations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**
- Backend runs on port 8000, frontend on port 5173
- Make sure no other applications are using these ports
- You can change the backend port by modifying the `port` variable in `index.ts`

**MongoDB connection issues:**
- Verify MongoDB is running locally on port 27017
- Check that the database name `ChatUsersDB` is correctly referenced
- Ensure Studio 3T can connect to your local MongoDB instance

**TypeScript compilation issues:**
- Make sure TypeScript is installed (`npm install -g typescript`)
- Check that all type definitions are properly installed
- Verify your `tsconfig.json` configuration

**Socket.io connection problems:**
- Ensure CORS is properly configured for `http://localhost:5173`
- Check that both frontend and backend are running
- Verify the socket connection URL in your frontend code

**Dependencies issues:**
- Try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again
- Ensure you're using compatible Node.js version (16.0.0+)
