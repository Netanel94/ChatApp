cd backend
# or wherever your backend code is located
```

Install backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your environment variables:
```env
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd ../frontend
# or wherever your React app is located
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Option 1: Run Backend and Frontend Separately

**Start the Backend Server:**
```bash
cd backend
npx ts-node index.ts
```
The backend server will run on `http://localhost:8000`

**Start the Frontend (in a new terminal):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Vite development server
```
The React app will run on `http://localhost:5173`

### Option 2: Run Both with Concurrently (if configured)

If you have a script to run both simultaneously:
```bash
npm run dev
# This would run both backend and frontend concurrently
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Setup

### Using Studio 3T with Local MongoDB
1. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine
2. Open Studio 3T
3. Create a new connection:
   - Connection Name: `ChatApp Local`
   - Server: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
   - Port: `27017` (default MongoDB port)
4. Connect to your MongoDB instance
5. The application will automatically create the `ChatUsersDB` database and required collections when you first run it
6. You can view and manage your data through Studio 3T's interface

### Database Schema
The application uses the following main collections in the `ChatUsersDB` database:
- `users` - User accounts and authentication data
- `messages` - Chat messages and metadata
- `conversations` - Chat room/conversation information

You can explore these collections in Studio 3T once the application creates them.
